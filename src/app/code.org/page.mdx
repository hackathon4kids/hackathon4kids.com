# Code.org Instructions!

Students will be learning computer science on Code.org: a fun,
creative platform for learning computer science and basic coding to create
interactive animations, games, and apps. Your interest in what your child is
learning is _critical_, and Code.org makes it easy to stay involved!

## Make the most of Code.org!

### 1. Encourage your child, show interest in computer science!

One of the best ways is to ask your child to explain what theyâ€™re learning and
show you a project they are proud of, see details. Or watch one of these videos
together.

### 2. Get your child set up to use Code.org at home

Our class uses Google Classroom accounts to sign in. To have your student sign
in to Code.org at home, do the following:

1. Go to [https://studio.code.org/](https://studio.code.org/) and click **Sign In**.

2. Choose **Continue with Google** and sign in via the Google sign-in dialog.
   At the top of their homepage, your student can continue the course they are
   doing with their classroom at school. They can also create their own games or
   artwork in the **Project Gallery** or check out [code.org/athome](code.org/athome) for ideas for
   things to work on at home.

4. **Connect your email to your student's account.** Keep up to date with what
your student is working on and receive updates from Code.org. Have your child
sign in to Code.org and then enter your email in **Account Settings** or click
here.

## Why Computer Science?

Six different studies show: children who study computer
science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem solving, and are 17%
more likely to attend college. Computer science teaches students critical
thinking, problem solving, and digital citizenship, and benefits all students,
no matter what opportunities they pursue in the future. And learning to make
interactive animations, code-art, games, and apps on Code.org encourages
creativity and makes learning fun.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you for your continued
support of your child and of our classroom!
